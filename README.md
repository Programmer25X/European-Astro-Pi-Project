# European Astro Pi Challenge 2023-2024

## Overview 
In 2023, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to partake in the European Astro Pi Challenge. Over the course of two months, myself and a peer were able to successfully develop a program written in the *Python* programming language that estimated the average speed of the ISS. Our program was successdully executed on the ISS in 2024. We later received certifications from the ESA and the data that was gathered when the program was executed on the ISS.


## My Contributions 
- Assisted with the development of the system that captures data from the Astro Pi computer's sensors and camera
- Developed the system responsible for saving the gathered images and data into the correct folders and files
- Debugged and fixed identified issues in the program's code


## Tools Used
- Thonny IDE
- Raspberry Pi
